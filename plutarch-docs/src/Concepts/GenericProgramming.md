# Generic programming over Plutarch types

## Prerequisites

### `Term`

A `Term` or `ClosedTerm` represents Plutus Lambda Calculus expression in Plutarch world.
Allows for additional checks and safety compared to UPLC.
See more: [Plutarch Terms](../Introduction/PlutarchTerms.md).

### Data and Scott encoding

Datatypes can be encoded using Scott and `Data` encoding.
These concepts are well explained in Plutonomicon:
[Data encoding](../Concepts/DataAndScottEncoding.md#data-encoding)
and [Scott encoding](../Concepts/DataAndScottEncoding.md#scott-encoding).

### `anyclass` deriving strategy

`anyclass` derivation strategy uses default implementation of given typeclass to derive an instance of it.
Usually depends that given datatype derives `Generic` typeclass also or some other too.

### generics-sop

A really good introduction to `generics-sop` by the maker of the library, Andres LÃ¶h, can be found
[in this YouTube video recorded at the 2020 ZuriHac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnrfREbhWY)

[Introduction by srid](https://srid.ca/generics-sop-intro).

Why is sum-of-products considered? It's very close to what developers think JSON is.

Generic representation of ADTs as sum of products, which can be automatically derived.
Some commonly used types/functions:

```
I - Identity functor (`newtype I a = I a`)
K - Constant functor (`newtype K a b = K a`)

Z - zero (as in Peano numbers)
S - successor (as in Peano numbers)

<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop-0.5.1.2/docs/Generics-SOP.html#t:NS>
NS - n-ary Sum
Picking nth element of sum comes from composing Z and S

<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop-0.5.1.2/docs/Generics-SOP.html#t:NP>
NP - n-ary Product
Value level witness for a list of types parametrized by some functor f.

SOP - sum of products
`SOP I` corresponds to haskell's structure of given SOP encoded datatype.
`SOP (Term s)` corresponds to Plutarch structure of given SOP encoded datatype.

`Code a`
The code of a datatype.

This is a list of lists of its components. The outer list contains one element per constructor. The inner list contains one element per constructor argument (field).
```

```haskell
data Tree = Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree
```

is supposed to have the following Representation:

```haskell
type TreeRepr =
  '[ '[ Int ]
   , '[ Tree, Tree ]
   ]
```

```hs
-- Generic representation of given Haskell datatype
type Rep a = SOP I (Code a)
```

This mechanism allows for generic programming over Haskell types and Plutarch types

## Intro

As Plutarch is an eDSL in Haskell, it does not allow us to work on Plutus-level variables directly.
Manipulating ADTs can be done in terms of `pcon` and `pmatch` which belong to a class called `PlutusType`.

How this class is implemented is not that important but can be looked up in `Plutarch/Internal/PlutusType.hs`
by the interested reader.

These typeclass methods could be written manually, but is a bit tedious and error-prone, thus the generic
representation from `GHC.Generics` is used.
Under the hood all necessary transformations are done to be able to access the data on Haskell level.

Also - as parsing data costs computation resources, it is common to pass tagged raw data until it's really needed to parse.
`PlutusType` typeclass serves 2 purposes:

1. Adds derivation via anyclass for Haskell ADTs
2. Manipulates given `S -> Type` on its internal representation (provided as type `PInner`), 
  rather than parsing/constructing the datatype back and forth.

Examples on how to derive `PlutusType` to either Data or Scott encoding:

```haskell
data MyType (a :: S -> Type) (b :: S -> Type) (s :: S)
  = One (Term s a)
  | Two (Term s b)
  deriving stock Generic
  deriving anyclass PlutusType
instance DerivePlutusType (MyType a b) where type DPTStrat _ = PlutusTypeScott

-- If you instead want to use data encoding, you should derive 'PlutusType' and provide data strategy:

data MyTypeD (a :: S -> Type) (b :: S -> Type) (s :: S)
  = OneD (Term s (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= a ]))
  | TwoD (Term s (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= b ]))
  deriving stock Generic
  deriving anyclass PlutusType
instance DerivePlutusType (MyTypeD a b) where type DPTStrat _ = PlutusTypeData

-- Alternatively, you may derive 'PlutusType' by hand as well. A simple example, encoding a
-- Sum type as an Enum via PInteger:

data AB (s :: S) = A | B

instance PlutusType AB where
  type PInner AB = PInteger

  pcon' A = 0
  pcon' B = 1

  pmatch' x f =
    pif (x #== 0) (f A) (f B)


-- instead of using `pcon'` and `pmatch'` directly,
-- use 'pcon' and 'pmatch', to hide the `PInner` type:

swap :: Term s AB -> Term s AB
swap x = pmatch x $ \case
  A -> pcon B
  B -> pcon A
```

`Maybe` manually encoded in both ways:

```haskell
-- | Scott
data PSMaybe a s = PSJust (Term s a) | PSNothing

-- | Newtype wrapper around function that represents Scott encoding,
-- | Plutarch uses generic one for deriving.
newtype ScottEncodedMaybe a b s = ScottEncodedMaybe (Term s ((a :--> b) :--> PDelayed b :--> b))

instance PlutusType (ScottEncodedMaybe a r) where
  type PInner (ScottEncodedMaybe a r) = (a :--> r) :--> PDelayed r :--> r
  pcon' (ScottEncodedMaybe x) = x
  pmatch' x f = f (ScottEncodedMaybe x)

instance PlutusType (PSMaybe a) where
  -- The resulting type of pattern matching on Maybe is quantified via `PForall`
  type PInner (PSMaybe a) = PForall (ScottEncodedMaybe a)
  pcon' (PSJust x) = pcon $ PForall $ pcon $ ScottEncodedMaybe $ plam $ \f _ -> f # x
  pcon' PSNothing = pcon $ PForall $ pcon $ ScottEncodedMaybe $ plam $ \_ g -> pforce g
  pmatch' x' f =
    pmatch x' $ \(PForall sem) ->
      pmatch sem $ \(ScottEncodedMaybe x) ->
        x # plam (f . PSJust) # pdelay (f PSNothing)

-- | Maybe encoded using Constr
data PMaybeData a (s :: S)
  = PDJust (Term s a)
  | PDNothing

-- | Note - thing hold in PMaybeData must be able to be represented as Data too, not needed in case of Scott version
instance PIsData a => PlutusType (PMaybeData a) where
  type PInner (PMaybeData a) = PData
  pcon' (PDJust x) = pforgetData $ pconstrBuiltin # 0 #$ psingleton # pforgetData (pdata x)
  pcon' PDNothing = pforgetData $ pconstrBuiltin # 1 # pnil
  pmatch' x f = (`runTermCont` f) $ do
    constrPair <- TermCont $ plet (pasConstr # x)
    indexNum <- TermCont $ plet (pfstBuiltin # constrPair)
    TermCont $ \g -> pif (indexNum #== 0)
        (g $ PDJust $ punsafeCoerce $ phead # (psndBuiltin # constrPair))
        (pif (indexNum #== 1)
          (g PDNothing)
          perror
        )

```

### Generic derivation of PCon/PMatch

The mechanism of `PlutusType` derivation relies heavily on generic representation of ADT as sum-of-products.
Very high level overview:
For `pmatch`:

- Scott encoding - for each `sum` branch, create a corresponding `plam` handler
- Data encoding - for each `sum` branch, apply each element of list in `Constr` to a handler

For `pcon`:

- Scott encoding - encode data type as lambda
- Data encoding - create a `Constr` with corresponding number of constructor

## Recommended patterns when working with pcon/pmatch

- [Tricks - Prefer matching on pmatch result immediately](../../Tricks/PreferMatchingOnPmatchResultImmediately.md)
- [Typeclasses - PlutusType, PCon, and PMatch - derive instances automatically](../../Typeclasses/PlutusType,PCon,PMatch.md)
