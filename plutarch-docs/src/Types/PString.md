# `PString`

`Term s PString` has a `IsString` instance. This allows you to make Plutarch level string terms from regular string literals, provided you have `OverloadedStrings` turned on.

```haskell
pfoo :: forall s. Term s PString
pfoo = "foo"
```

It also has a `PEq` instance. And its terms have `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances - which work the way you would expect.

It **does not** have a `PlutusType` instance.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin string](https://plutonomicon.github.io/plutarch-plutus/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins-Internal.html#t:BuiltinString) (actually Text).
