# `PInteger`

`Term s PInteger` has a convenient `Num` instance that allows you to construct Plutarch level integer terms from integer literals.
It also means you have all the typical arithmetic operations available to you:

```hs
1 + 2
```

where `1` and `2` are `Term s PInteger`s.

Alongside `Num`, it also has a `PIntegral` instance, allowing you to use division, modulus etc.

It also has a `PEq` and `POrd` instance, allowing you to do Plutarch level equality and comparison.

It **does not** have a `PlutusType` instance.

> Note: be aware that GHC offers constant folding, i.e. at compile time expressions like `3 * 20000` will be folded to their result. This is important
> because if you were to instead use the Plutarch level function, the evaluation would instead be delayed until plutarch runtime increasing the script
> cost.

This is synonymous to Plutus Core [builtin integer](https://plutonomicon.github.io/plutarch-plutus/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-Builtins-Internal.html#t:BuiltinInteger).
