# The isomorphism between `makeIsDataIndexed`, Haskell ADTs, and `PIsDataRepr`

When [implementing `PIsDataRepr`](./../Typeclasses/PIsDataReprAndPDataFields.md#implementing-pisdatarepr-and-friends) for a Plutarch type, if the Plutarch type also has a [Haskell synonym](./../Concepts/HaskellSynonym.md) (e.g. `ScriptContext` is the Haskell synonym to `PScriptContext`) that uses [`makeIsDataIndexed`](https://plutonomicon.github.io/plutarch-plutus/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx-IsData.html#v:makeIsDataIndexed) - you must make sure the constructor ordering is correct.

In particular, with `makeIsDataIndexed`, you can assign _indices_ to your Haskell ADT's constructors. This determines how the ADT will be represented in Plutus Core. It's important to ensure that the corresponding Plutarch type _knows_ about these indices so it can decode the ADT correctly - in case you passed it into Plutarch code, through Haskell.

For example, consider `Maybe`. Plutus assigns these indices to its constructors:

```hs
makeIsDataIndexed ''Maybe [('Just, 0), ('Nothing, 1)]
```

0 to `Just`, 1 to `Nothing`. So the corresponding Plutarch type, `PMaybeData` is defined as:

```hs
data PMaybeData a (s :: S)
  = PDJust (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= a]))
  | PDNothing (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
```

It'd be a very subtle mistake to instead define it as:

```hs
data PMaybeData a (s :: S)
  = PDNothing (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
  | PDJust (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= a]))
```

The constructor ordering is wrong!

It's not just constructor ordering that matters - field ordering does too! Though this is self explanatory. Notice how `PTxInfo` shares the exact same field ordering as its Haskell synonym - `TxInfo`.

```hs
newtype PTxInfo (s :: S)
  = PTxInfo
      ( Term
          s
          ( PDataRecord
              '[ "inputs" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PTxInInfo)
               , "outputs" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PTxOut)
               , "fee" ':= PValue
               , "mint" ':= PValue
               , "dcert" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PDCert)
               , "wdrl" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData (PBuiltinPair (PAsData PStakingCredential) (PInteger)))
               , "validRange" ':= PPOSIXTimeRange
               , "signatories" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData PPubKeyHash)
               , "datums" ':= PBuiltinList (PAsData (PBuiltinPair (PAsData PDatumHash) (PAsData PDatum)))
               , "id" ':= PTxId
               ]
          )
      )
```

```hs
data TxInfo = TxInfo
  { txInfoInputs      :: [TxInInfo]
  , txInfoOutputs     :: [TxOut]
  , txInfoFee         :: Value
  , txInfoMint        :: Value
  , txInfoDCert       :: [DCert]
  , txInfoWdrl        :: [(StakingCredential, Integer)]
  , txInfoValidRange  :: POSIXTimeRange
  , txInfoSignatories :: [PubKeyHash]
  , txInfoData        :: [(DatumHash, Datum)]
  , txInfoId          :: TxId
  }
```

The _field names_ don't matter though. They are merely labels that don't exist at runtime.

## What about `newtype`s?

Of course, this does not apply when you're using `newtype` derivation (e.g `derive newtype ...`) to derive `FromData` or `ToData` for your PlutusTx types. In that case, the `Data` representation is simply the same as the inner type.

```hs
import qualified PlutusTx
import PlutusTx.Prelude

newtype CurrencySymbol = CurrencySymbol { unCurrencySymbol :: BuiltinByteString }
  deriving newtype (PlutusTx.ToData, PlutusTx.FromData, PlutusTx.UnsafeFromData)
```

Here, for example, `CurrencySymbol` has the very same `Data` representation as `BuiltinByteString`. No extra information is added.

> note that in plutarch what matters is not whether you declare a datatype as haskell data or as haskell newtype but in what
  way you derive the plutuscore representation
