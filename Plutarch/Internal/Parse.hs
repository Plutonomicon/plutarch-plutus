{- | Describes a @Data@ encoded Plutarch type that requires some additional
validation to ensure its structure is indeed what we expect. This is
especially useful for datums or other user-supplied arguments, since these
can be malformed.

= Why the CPS

'pwithValidated' is written in continuation-passing style (or CPS) for
reasons of efficiency. As 'pwithValidated' is meant to check structure (and
nothing more), our first instinct would be to write something like

@pwithValidated :: Term s PData -> Term s PBool@

or

@pwithValidated :: Term s PData -> Term s PUnit@

and rely on 'perror' to sort things out. However, constructing either 'PUnit'
or 'PBool' isn't free, and ultimately, this value ends up unused. At the same
time, we want to ensure that the validation specified in 'pwithValidated' is
actually performed, which neither of the above signatures can promise
anything about.

CPS solves both of these problems. Since the result of 'pwithValidated' is
technically a function that /must/ behave the same no matter what type of @r@
it operates over, we can't do anything except potentially mess with the
argument 'PData' or error out, which means we don't need to allocate any
\'result value\'. Furthermore, by working in CPS, we ensure that any
validation defined in 'pwithValidated' must happen, even if the 'PData' (or
whatever it's supposed to be) is never handled or forced.

= Important note

It is essential practice to document what /exactly/ any given instance of
'PValidateData' checks. Each instance should specify this: all the instances
provided by Plutarch and its related libraries follow this rule.

It is kept out of 'PValidateData' for efficiency and safety reasons.
