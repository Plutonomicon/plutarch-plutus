{- | This class provides a work-around for partially applying
 type families of kind @a@, where @a@ is either 'Type' or
 @b -> c@ where @c@ satisfies the same constraint.

 Given a type family @F : A -> Type@, you can make the following
 @
   type F' :: A -> Type
   newtype F' (a :: A) = F' (NoReduce (F a)) deriving stock Generic
 @
 It is then true that @forall a. Reduce (F' a) ~ F a@.
