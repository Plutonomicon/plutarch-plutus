# Revision history for plutarch

# 1.4.0

- Renamed `punionWith` and `punionWithData` of `Plutarch.Api.V1.AssocMap` to
  `punionResolvingCollisionsWith` and `punionResolvingCollisionsWithData`, since
  they have been misused for what should have been `pzipWith` and `pzipWithData`.
- Renamed `punionWith` and `punionWithData` of `Plutarch.Api.V1.Value` to
  `punionResolvingCollisionsWith` and `punionResolvingCollisionsWithData`, since
  they have been misused for what should have been `pzipWith` and `pzipWithData`.
- Introduced `pzipWith`, `pzipWithData`, `pzipWithDefault`, `pzipWithDataDefault`,
  `pzipWithDefaults`, `pzipWithDataDefaults`, `pintersectionWith`, and
  `pintersectionWithData` in `Plutarch.Api.V1.AssocMap`. Also introduced the
  types `BothPresentHandler`, `BothPresentHandlerCommutative`,
  `OnePresentHandler`, `MergeHandler` and `SomeMergeHandler` for instructing
  `pzipWith` and `pzipWithData`.
- Added `Commutativity` in `AssocMap` for instructing various `AssocMap` and
  `Value` operations about the commutativity of the given value-merging
  function.
- Renamed `pdifference` in `AssocMap` to `punsortedDifference` (O(n^2)).
  Introduced new `pdifference` with stricter constraints and O(n).
- Added `pleftBiasedUnion` in `Plutarch.Api.V1.AssocMap`.
- Added `pleftBiasedCurrencyUnion` and `pleftBiasedTokenUnion` in
  `Plutarch.Api.V1.Value`.

# 1.3.0

- Support newer Plutus
- Remove most of the Nix code and switch to mlabs-tooling.nix

# 1.2.1

- Exported data constructors instance for `Plutarch.Lift (LiftError)`

# 1.2 (WIP changelog)

- Changed fields of `PTxInfo` whose only representation is data to not be wrapped by `PAsData`.

  Module: `Plutarch.Api.V1.Contexts`; `Plutarch.Api.V2.Contexts`

- Added `plistData` builtin function wrapper.

  Module: `Plutarch.Builtin`

- Added `PEq` superclass constraint to `POrd`

  Included by [#326](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/326)

- Added module `Plutarch.Show` with the `PShow` type class, as well as functions `pshow` and `ptraceShowId`.

  Started by [#352](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/352)

- Add `puncons` and `ptryUncons` functions for deconstructing list.

  Started by: [#333](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/333)

- Add generic deriving for `PEq`

  Started by [#335](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/335)
- `Plutarch.Prelude` and `Plutarch.List` now export pfind, pelemAt, preserve and pcheckSroted.

  Started by: [#306](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/306)

- Added module `Plutarch.FFI` for interoperability with PlutusTx.

- Added `DerivePConstantViaBuiltin`, deprecating `DerivePConstantViaNewtype`.

- `TermCont`: Parametrize by result type; add `MonadFail` instance; etc.

  Also, export from `Plutarch.TermCont`, and then from `Plutarch.Prelude` (TermCont is no longer exported by `Plutarch.Internal`).

  Started by: [#226](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/226)

- Add `PlutusType` generic deriving support for data encoded Plutarch types, via `PIsDataRepr` and `PIsDataReprInstances`.

  All existing ledger api types now have `PlutusType` instances - not just `PMatch`.

  Started by: [#250](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/250)

- Add `PDataRecord` construction utilities, necessary for full usage of data encoded `PlutusType` instances.

  In particular, you can build `PDataRecord`s with `pdcons` and `pdnil` - refer to the guide for more info.

  `pdcons` and `pdnil` are also exported from `Plutarch.Prelude`.

  Also add `PlutusType` instance for `PDataRecord`.

  Module: `Plutarch.DataRepr.Internal`

  Started by: [#250](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/250)

- Export `PLabeledType ((:=))` from `Plutarch.Prelude`.

  Added by: [#250](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/250)

- Add `pconstantData` - an efficient way of building data encoded constants directly.

  This is semantically equivalent to `pdata . pconstant` but does not do any extra builtin function call.

  Module: `Plutarch.Builtin`

  Added by: [#251](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/251)

- Added APIs for constructing, compiling, serialising & hashing Plutarch scripts.

  Type synonyms for Plutarch-typed scripts `PValidator`,`PMintingPolicy` & `PStakeValidator`.

  `mkValidator`, `mkStakeValidator` & `mkMintingPolicy` functions, for creating Plutus API compatible scripts.

  `validatorHash`, `mintingPolicySymbol` & `stakeValidatorHash` to obtain script hashes.

  Module: `Plutarch.V1.Api`

  See: `Plutarch.ScriptsSpec` in `plutarch-test` for usage examples.

  Added by: [#267](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/267)
- Add `PTuple` construction and related utilities.

  Module: `Plutarch.Api.V1.Tuple`

  Added by: [#255](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/255)

- Add `PIsData` instances for `PUnit` and `PBuiltinPair (PAsData a) (PAsData b)`.

  It's helpful to mentally note that `PTuple a b`, `PAsData (PTuple a b)` and `PBuiltinPair (PAsData a) (PAsData b)` all have the exact same underlying representation. See `Plutarch.Api.V1.Tuple` for no-op conversion functions.

  Module: `Plutarch.Builtin`

  Added by: [#255](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/255)

- Add implicit `pfromData` for `hrecField` and the record dot. Add implicit `pfromData` for `pfield`.

  Module: `Plutarch.DataRepr`

  Added by: [#235](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/270)

- Add `Plutarch.Test` for testing Plutarch code with goldens for UPLC printing and Plutus benchmarks.

- Add Conversion types `PTryFrom`, `PMaybeFrom` and `PFrom`

  Module: `Plutarch.TryFrom`

  Added by: [#326](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/326)

- `plutarch-extra`: Add a new directory scaffold "`plutarch-extra`" which will be home to everything too specific to not be in the
  main Plutarch repo. Also refactored the test library.

  Directory: `plutarch-extra`

  Added by: [#329](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/329)

- `plutarch-extra` export merged Prelude

  Module: `Plutarch.PPrelude`

  Added by: [#356](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/356)

- Add `PConstant` instance for `Maybe`, with corresponding `PLift` instance for `PMaybeData`.

  Added by: [#371](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/371)

- Add `POrd` and `PEq` derivation for data encoded types via `PIsDataReprInstances`.

  Added by: [#371](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/371)

- Make `PRational` construction machinery fail when the denominator is 0.

  Fixed by: [#299](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/299)

- Rename `PConstant` (the typeclass) to `PConstantDecl`. `PConstant` is now a type alias with extra constraints for better type checking.

  Add `PLiftData` and `PConstantData` type aliases.

  Added by: [#354](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/354)

- Remove `hrecField` export. Use `getField` instead.

  Removed by: [#415](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/415)

- Rename the `"data"` field of `PTxInfo` to `"datums"`.

  Renamed by: [#415](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/415)

- Add `Num` instance for `PPOSIXTime` and export its constructor.

  Added by: [#415](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/415)

- `PlutusType` is now a superclass of `PIsDataRepr`, strengthening the existing `PMatch` superclass constraint.

  Added by: [#415](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/415)

- Add `PlutusType` instance for `PDataSum`. `PDataSum` can now be hand-constructed.

  Added by: [#345](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/345)

- Add `HRecOf`, `PMemberFields`, and `PMemberField` utility types.

  Module: `Plutarch.DataRepr`.

  Added by: [#466](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/466)

- Move `Plutarch.ListUtils` to `Plutarch.Extra.List`.

  Added by: [#466](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/466)

- Add various `TermCont` utilities: `ptraceC`, `pletFieldsC`, `ptryFromC`, `pguardC`, and `pguardC'`.

  Module: `Plutarch.Extra.TermCont`.

  Added by: [#466](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutarch/pull/466)

# 1.0.0

Somewhat stable release
